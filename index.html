  <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am a PhD student in the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington. I have a passion 
      for the ocean and understanding the mechanisms that drive the motion of the ocean with a specific 
      emphasis on the nearshore environment. When not trying to learn about the Earth, you can find me outside
      trying to experience the Earth while skiing, biking, swimming and wandering around. I love burritos and 
      Indian food and I am always up for a cup of coffee with a friend or friend to be.

  <h2>Research</h2>
    <p> I am currently a PhD student working with the Air-Sea Interaction and Remote Sensing (AIRS) group and 
      he Environmental Fluid Mechanics(EFM) group studying nearshore hydrodynamics and water wave mechanics. 
      I am co-adivsed by Dr. Jim Thomson, Dr. Melissa Moulton and Dr. Morteza Derakhti. I studied mechanical
      engineering at California Polytechnic State University - SLO and was advised by Dr. Ryan Walter.
