  <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am a PhD student in the Applied Physics Lab at the University of Washington. I work with the
       Air-Sea Interaction and Remote Sensing (AIRS) group and the Environmental Fluid Mechanics Group studying 
       nearshore hydrodynamics and water wave mechanics.

  <h2>Research</h2>
    <p> I have a passion for the ocean and understanding the mechanisms that drive the motion of the ocean 
    with a specific emphasis on the nearshore environment. 
    </p>

  <h2>Fun</h2>
